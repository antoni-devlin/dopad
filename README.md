# Dopad

Dopad is a todo list Single Page App (SPA) built in vanilla javascript, themed to look like Windows 10 notepad. All tasks are stored in the browser.

It allows quickly adding tasks, editing tasks, checking tasks off when complete, deleting individual tasks, and clearing all tasks from storage.
